# DreamersInc Interview Code

 Notebooks and data for the Dreamers Inc. coding challenge

I initially wanted to follow a more technical-indicator style approach, but when testing deep learning my results were so promising that I just went with that for my final solution. The code for that can be found in `notebooks/neural_net.ipynb` and the model itself can be found in `trained-models/neural-net.keras`.

Thanks for a fun data science challenge!
